# Retail Sales Performance Analysis 

This project explores and analyzes a retail sales dataset to uncover insights about sales performance, customer segments, regional trends, and the impact of discounts on profitability.

## Project Title: Retail Sales – Driving Growth with Data

## Background

Retail businesses generate large amounts of sales data, but without analysis, valuable insights are often missed. This project focuses on understanding **which regions, products, and customer segments drive the most revenue** and how **discounts impact profitability**.  

By cleaning and analyzing the data, we can provide clear recommendations to improve decision-making, increase sales, and boost overall profitability.

## Business Task

Determine how sales, profits, and discounts vary across products, regions, and customer segments so the business can identify growth opportunities, reduce losses, and make smarter decisions.

## Tools Used

- **Excel** – for initial data cleaning (removing spaces, standardizing formats, verifying numeric columns, removing irrelevant columns).  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  

## Data Source

The data was taken from the [Superstore dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final). It includes several years of historical sales records across regions, product categories, sales, profits, and discounts.


## Summarized Findings

* The West region generated the highest sales, while the South had the lowest

* Sales show monthly fluctuations, revealing seasonal patterns

* Corporate, Consumer, and Home Office segments differ in total sales levels

* Certain regions perform better in specific months

* Higher discounts often reduce profits, varying across categories

* A few sub-categories drive the majority of sales

## Recommendations

* Strengthen sales efforts in the South while maximizing gains in the West

* Use seasonal sales patterns to guide promotions and inventory planning

* Focus on top customer segments with loyalty and retention strategies

* Adjust discounting to boost sales without hurting profits

* Keep best-selling products well-stocked and prominently marketed

* Align regional and seasonal insights for more effective planning

## Outputs

All analysis and visualizations are included in the projeect folders in this repository.
